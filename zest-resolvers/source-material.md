# Understanding Jest's Package

## Overview

The `jest-resolve` package is responsible for resolving module paths and dependencies in Jest. Its main responsibilities include:

- Resolving imports and requires to actual file paths
- Handling custom module resolution (e.g. aliases, mocks, node_modules)
- Supporting platform-specific and environment-specific resolution
- Integrating with haste-map for fast lookups
- Providing APIs for the test runner and transformer to load modules reliably

`jest-resolve` ensures that all modules and dependencies are found and loaded correctly, supporting Jest's isolation and mocking features.
