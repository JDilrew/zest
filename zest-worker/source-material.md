# Understanding Jest's Package

## Overview

The `jest-worker` package is used by Jest to manage parallel execution of tasks, such as running tests or building haste-maps. Its main responsibilities include:

- Creating and managing a pool of worker processes or threads
- Distributing tasks (test files, file indexing) across workers for parallel execution
- Handling communication, messaging, and error propagation between main and worker processes
- Ensuring isolation and reliability of each worker
- Optimizing performance by balancing workload and minimizing overhead

`jest-worker` is a key part of Jest's speed and scalability, enabling efficient use of system resources for large test suites.
