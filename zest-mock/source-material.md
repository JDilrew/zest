# Understanding Jest's Package

## Overview

The `jest-mock` package provides Jest's core mocking functionality. Its main responsibilities include:

- Creating mock functions (spies, stubs) to track calls, arguments, and results
- Allowing replacement of modules and functions with mocks for isolation and testing
- Supporting manual and automatic mocking of dependencies
- Providing APIs for resetting, clearing, and restoring mocks
- Integrating with the test runner and environment for seamless mocking

`jest-mock` enables powerful and flexible mocking, spying, and stubbing capabilities, making it easy to test code in isolation and verify interactions.
