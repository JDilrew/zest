# Understanding Jest's Package

## Overview

The `jest-circus` package is Jest's default test execution engine. Its main responsibilities are:

- Registering and organizing tests and `describe` blocks
- Managing the lifecycle of tests, hooks (`beforeAll`, `afterEach`, etc.), and suites
- Handling synchronous and asynchronous test execution
- Tracking and reporting test results, errors, and logs
- Emitting events for reporters and custom integrations
- Supporting isolation, error handling, and predictable test order

`jest-circus` is the core engine that runs your tests, coordinates hooks, and provides the event system for reporting and diagnostics in Jest.
