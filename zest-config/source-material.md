# Understanding Jest's Configs Package

## Overview

The `jest-config` package is responsible for loading, validating, and merging configuration options for Jest. It processes user-defined config files (like `jest.config.js` or fields in `package.json`), applies defaults, and resolves presets and overrides. This package ensures that all test runner settings—such as test environment, reporters, transform options, and module paths—are correctly interpreted and passed to Jest's core. It also supports extending and composing configs for complex setups.
