# Understanding Jest's Package

## Overview

The `jest-reporters` package is responsible for collecting, formatting, and outputting test results in Jest. Its main responsibilities include:

- Aggregating results from all test files and suites
- Formatting output for the terminal, CI, or custom destinations
- Handling logs, errors, coverage, and snapshot diffs
- Supporting custom reporters and integrations (e.g. HTML, JSON, CI tools)
- Providing feedback on test status, failures, and performance
- Emitting events for plugins and watch mode

`jest-reporters` makes it easy to understand test outcomes, debug failures, and integrate Jest with other tools and workflows.
