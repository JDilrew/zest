# Understanding Jest's Runtime Package

## Overview

The `jest-runtime` package is responsible for creating and managing the execution context for each test file in Jest. It provides isolation by sandboxing test code, handles module loading and mocking, and applies code transformations as needed. The runtime ensures that each test runs with the correct globals, mocks, and environment, and it intercepts imports and requires to support features like manual mocks and custom transformations. This package is central to Jest's ability to provide reliable, isolated, and customizable test execution.
