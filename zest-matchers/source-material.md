# Understanding Jest's Package

## Overview

The `jest-expect` and `expect` packages provide Jest's assertion and matcher functionality. Their main responsibilities include:

- Defining core matchers (e.g. `toBe`, `toEqual`, `toThrow`, etc.) for assertions in tests
- Allowing custom matchers to be added for more expressive tests
- Tracking and reporting assertion results and errors
- Integrating with the test runner for result aggregation and reporting
- Supporting snapshot matchers and advanced assertion features

Together, `jest-expect` and `expect` make it easy to write clear, expressive, and reliable assertions in Jest tests, and to extend the assertion library as needed.
