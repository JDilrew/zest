# Understanding Jest's Package

## Overview

The `jest-transform` package is responsible for transforming source code before it is executed in Jest. Its main responsibilities include:

- Applying Babel, TypeScript, or other transformations to test and source files
- Supporting custom transformers for different file types (e.g. CSS, images, JSX)
- Integrating with the test runner to ensure transformed code is executed in the correct environment
- Caching transformed code for performance
- Handling source maps for accurate error reporting and debugging

`jest-transform` enables Jest to support modern JavaScript features, preprocessors, and custom file types, making it highly flexible and extensible.
